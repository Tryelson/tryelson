### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front-end engineer specializing in building exceptional digital experiences. Currently, I'm focused on building accessible, scalable and human-centered products at HiveGroup, focusing on user experience. Acting in the construction and maintenance of project management systems, Landing Pages and websites.

My main focus these days is building products for our clients at HiveGroup. In my free time I like to play video games, play drums, hang out with my wife and build personal projects.
