### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front-end engineer specializing in building exceptional digital experience. Currently, I'm focused on building accessible, scalable, human-centered products at HiveGroup, focusing on user experience. Acting in the construction and maintenance of project management systems, Landing Pages and websites.

My main focus these days is building products for our clients at HiveGroup. In my free time I like to play video games, hanging out with my wife and build personal projects.
